# Dockerized 2048 Game Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Project Description

This project involves creating a game using Docker and deploying it to AWS. Docker is a tool that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit. This makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on different environments. AWS is a cloud computing platform that provides a variety of services, including Elastic Beanstalk, which is a service that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on AWS.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` and add the following lines:

### 2. Build the Docker image

    docker build -t 2048-game .

### 3. Create a container from the Docker image

    docker run -d -p 80:80 2048-game

### 4. Deploy the container to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk
- Create an Elastic Beanstalk application.
- Upload the Dockerfile to the Elastic Beanstalk application.
- Create an environment for the Elastic Beanstalk application.
- Launch the Elastic Beanstalk application.
